# Barky-Service-Transformation

This repo is for implement some features and testing

Questions we trying to answer:

- Barky has some good design choices but it is not architected
- Barky could benefit from a service layer
- Barky could use a moder HTTP/REST service layer implementation
- Barky could benefit from the use of an ORM
- Barky can be proven as viable simply through tests, with the need for a UI
